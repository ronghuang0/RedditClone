find a way to stay signed in

im thinking about using username/pw to sign in, but people probably aren’t going to want to type in their passwords.

look at mobile site to get an idea of howthey use the  api

client_id: aO_hakV12sMyFA
secret: 07uq5ys9b9DNhc6payeqCWXz15g


there is a ‘likes’ parameter for each post. use oauth.reddit…… remember to use the right scope. 

A space-separated list of scope strings


for the upvotes, they change the width based on the biggest # of digits on the page for the upvotes.

make screen smaller and then scroll right

when on front app. if i have count in the url then the activeLink won’t be active

only front and all should have links to other subreddits within events

when i click on the subreddit link in an event it updates and doesn’t go to top of screen if it goes from app to app. works if i go from front app to app. 

bug: go to a page with less than 25 posts and start clicking next/prev


it’s really dumb using frontapp and app.


make sure you make it so the spriteurlimage only loads once


/r/random redirects to some random

there are some empty children. 
id is the actual id of the comment

‘more’ contains an array of children that are direct replies
from what it seems, it doesn’t contain any ‘more’, it includes those already.
i think i’m going to skip this feature lol

if there is a more comments link that are replies to a particular comment that means the array elements are all direct replies.

save scroll position

page size changes with expand/close comments


make reddit. 

no subreddits. no users as of now. anyone can upvote or post. 

there are many clones, just copy one of those for styling. 


www.reddit.com/r/all.json

preview: {images: [{source: {url:__, width:__, height:__}, resolutions: [{}}] }

they want us to use oauth

https://www.reddit.com/r/all.json?after=t3_51962h

this gives us the 25 posts after the type+id. 


if someone creates a new post, it is saved to to a  database


the link is a get request to get an html from the db. How do we make the html?? 


when we click the link we want to send the get request, when we get back the json we want to build the page. 


children[0].data     replies.data

children[0].data.replies.data.children[0].data.replies.data
